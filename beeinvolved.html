    <ul id="my-list">
          
          <li class="action-li">
            🌷 Step 1: Stop using chemical-based pesticides and fertilizers! Synthetic compounds like these, along with other herbicides and neonicotinoids, hurt bees. Instead, use organic and natural solutions like compost!
          </li>
          
          <li class="action-li">
           🌸 Step 2: Plant pollinator-friendly plants! Planting such plants in your garden and your community help increase safe habitats and food resources for bees! A few good plant choices include mint, lavender, and poppies. 
          </li>
          
          <li class="action-li">
           🌼 Step 3: Make a Bee Bath! A bee bath is a perfect addition to your bee garden of pollinator-friendly plants. Just simply fill a shallow bowl with clean water, and arrange stones inside so that they break the water’s surface and give the bees a place to land! 
          </li>
          
          <li class="action-li">
           🌺 Step 4: Support local beekeepers and organizations! When you can, buy your honey and beeswax products from local farmers or farmers’ markets. This helps support the hard work local beekeepers do to nurture their bees!
          </li>
          
           <li class="action-li">
           🌹 Step 5: Get involved in your community! You can get involved with local organizations and governments to help enrich public and shared spaces with more pollinator-friendly plants, trees, and native bee homes. Some bee organizations make it possible to purchase solitary bee homes to put in your local environment (garden, schools, etc).
          </li>
          
           <li class="action-li">
           🌻 Step 6: Donate! By donating to beekeeping societies and environmental groups, you can help further their mission of raising awareness about and working towards bee conservation.
          </li>
          
        </ul>

          Action Items List: What can governments and organizations?

    <div class="list2">
             
        <p>
          🌱 1. Reduce the sale and use of pesticides: Many corporations like Home Depot and Walmart are moving away from selling bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides while others, like Amazon, have not. It is important that the government moves towards banning the widespread use of such harmful chemicals.
        </p>
         
        <p>
           🍃  2. Protect and restore safe havens for bees: Bee habitats are being threatened. In order to combat this, parks, wildlife refuges, national parks, and urban landscapes should be free of bee-killing pesticides and conserved as pollinator habitats.
        </p>
         
        <p>
           🌿 3. Public planting: Working towards planting more pollinator-friendly plants, wildflowers, and trees in parks, roadsides, and other public places to provide additional food sources and habitats for bees.
        </p>
         
        <p>
           ☘️ 4. Research: Conducting further research is vital to improve the health and wellbeing of bees and to discover the effects of pesticides and pathogens, and other mortality causes on colonies. Organizations can also research how to improve bee resistance to such diseases and increase pollination efficiency.
